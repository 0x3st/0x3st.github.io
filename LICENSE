Anti-Exploitation Public License (AEPL)

Version 1.0

Copyright (c) 2026 530(0x3st)

The Anti-Exploitation Public License (AEPL) is the spiritual successor to the
Anti 996 License. While its predecessor fought for time, AEPL fights for
dignity. We believe that code is a product of free will and should not be used
to optimize the enslavement of humanity.

Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy
of this software and associated documentation files (the "Work"), to deal in
the Work without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use,
copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of
the Work, and to permit persons to whom the Work is furnished to do so,
subject to the following conditions:

DEFINITIONS

"Licensor" refers to the original author(s) of the Work.
"Licensee" refers to any individual or entity exercising rights under this
license.
"Worker" refers to any person contributing labor to the Licensee, including
full-time employees, part-time staff, independent contractors, gig workers,
interns, and outsourced personnel.
"Blocklist" refers to the publicly maintained list of exploitative entities
located at https://github.com/AEPL-Project/APEL-1.0/blob/main/blocklist.json.

ANTI-EXPLOITATION CONDITIONS

The above rights are strictly conditional upon the Licensee's adherence to
the following standards:

(a) The Licensee must strictly comply with all applicable labor laws in their
    jurisdiction. In jurisdictions with weak labor protections, the Licensee
    must adhere to the core conventions of the International Labour
    Organization (ILO).

(b) The Licensee shall not use the Work to create systems that:
    (i)   Monitor Workers' non-work activities or private communications;
    (ii)  Enforce algorithmic management that disregards Workers' physical or
          mental safety;
    (iii) Penalize Workers for exercising their "Right to Disconnect" outside
          of agreed working hours.

(c) If the Licensee uses the Work to develop Artificial Intelligence systems
    intended to automate tasks currently performed by Workers, the Licensee
    must provide affected Workers with a transition plan, including retraining
    or fair severance compensation.

(d) The Licensee guarantees that no part of their direct supply chain involves
    forced labor or child labor.

BLOCKLIST TERMINATION

If the Licensee (or its parent company, subsidiaries, or majority-owned
affiliates) is listed on the Blocklist with an "ACTIVE" status, all rights
granted under this License are automatically and immediately terminated. There
is no option to purchase a separate commercial license to bypass this
termination. Violation of human rights cannot be offset by monetary payment.
