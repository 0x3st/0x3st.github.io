# My First Blog Post

Welcome to my markdown-only blog! This is an example article.

## Why Markdown?

Markdown is simple, portable, and perfect for writing content. With this blog system, I can:

- Write articles in pure markdown
- Version control everything with Git
- Automatically generate a beautiful blog with GitHub Actions

## How It Works

1. Write markdown files in the `_posts/` directory
2. Push to GitHub
3. GitHub Actions runs `build.py` automatically
4. The blog is rebuilt and published!

That's all there is to it. Happy blogging! 🎉
